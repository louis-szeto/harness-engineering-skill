description: >
  A persistent autonomous engineering harness runtime that transforms any repository into a
  self-improving software system. Use this skill whenever the user wants to: build or run an
  autonomous coding agent, set up a self-healing engineering loop, orchestrate multi-agent
  software development, implement harness engineering principles, create a doc-driven
  development workflow, or run long-horizon autonomous software tasks. Trigger on phrases like
  "autonomous agent", "self-healing codebase", "harness engineering", "multi-agent pipeline",
  "continuous improvement loop", "OpenClaw skill", or any request for an agentic engineering
  system that runs without constant human input. Primarily designed for Claude Code and
  OpenClaw environments.

# HARNESS AUTONOMOUS RUNTIME

A production-grade skill for Claude Code and OpenClaw that transforms a repository into a
self-improving software system using six core harness engineering principles.

---

## SIX CORE PRINCIPLES

### P1: CONTEXT ENGINEERING
Treat context as a finite, precious resource. Curate aggressively.
- Read CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md first for base knowledge -- never infer what is written
- Pull runtime/error logs for real-time status, not docs (docs lie; codebase does not)
- 40% Rule: compact or outsource to a sub-agent when context exceeds 40% of window
- Use sub-agents to isolate concerns and prevent context pollution in the main agent
- Three-phase sub-agent model: Research => Plan => Implement (see agents/dispatcher.md)
- Anything the agent cannot access is assumed to not exist

### P2: TOOL USAGE
Each sub-agent receives only the tools it needs -- no more.
- Tools are assigned per-role (see tools/TOOL_REGISTRY.md, per-agent subsets)
- All tools use MCP (Model Context Protocol) as the unified interface
- Generated code runs in a sandbox isolated from the harness security context
- Harness secrets are never visible to generated code or agent context directly

### P3: VERIFICATION MECHANISM
Every output is verified by someone other than who produced it.
- Deterministic first: linter, pre-commit hooks, structured tests -- no LLM judgment
- Generation-review isolation: the agent that writes code never reviews its own code
- 3-layer recursive review: reviewer sub-agents => comment-generator => implementer =>
  re-review, recursively until all reviewers approve
- Details in references/testing-standards.md and agents/reviewer.md

### P4: STATUS MANAGEMENT
State lives outside the context window, in the repo.
- Progress tracked in docs/status/PROGRESS.md (structured checklist markdown)
- Git commit after every atomic task completion (checkpoint)
- Context reset = new chat + structured handoff from docs/status/HANDOFF.md
- Checkpoint recovery: new agent reads handoff and resumes from last checkpoint
- Details in runtime/status-management.md

### P5: OBSERVABILITY AND FEEDBACK CLOSED-LOOP
Track what happens. Feed failures back into the harness, not the code.
- Execution tracking in docs/generated/tool-logs/
- Quality categorization and prioritization (see runtime/observability.md)
- Abnormality detection: unexpected patterns trigger debugger_agent
- Critical: when a failure occurs, analyze the harness gap -- not the model or code
- Continuously improve the harness, not just the application
- Details in runtime/observability.md

### P6: HUMAN SUPERVISION
Humans approve high-impact events. The harness surfaces them explicitly.
- Plan approval before implementation begins
- Architecture changes require human sign-off
- Failure retry decisions after N retries
- Lifespan hooks: on-start, on-plan-complete, on-cycle-complete, on-error, on-halt
- Details in runtime/autonomy-rules.md

## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md IS GROUND TRUTH -- read it first, every session.
2. CODEBASE OVER DOCS -- when they conflict, trust the code.
3. 40% CONTEXT RULE -- compact or sub-agent before crossing 40% of context window.
4. NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT a research output, a plan, and validation criteria.
5. GENERATION AND REVIEW ARE ALWAYS SEPARATE -- never the same agent.
6. FAILURE = HARNESS GAP -- fix the harness, not just the symptom.
7. OPTIMIZATION PRIORITY: Security => Correctness => Reliability => Performance =>
   Memory => Maintainability => Cost

---

## SAFE START GUIDE

Before anything else: read PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md and verify every item.
The harness depends on platform enforcement that cannot be checked from these files alone.

Step 1 -- Verify platform requirements (PLATFORM_REQUIREMENTS.md)
Run through the five platform capability checks before any other step.

Step 2 -- Sandbox first
Run on a throwaway branch. Observe one single-pass cycle before enabling continuous mode.

Step 2 -- Review CONFIG.yaml before every run
| loop_mode            | single-pass | Change after sandbox validation        |
| max_parallel_agents  | 3           | Increase after confirming behavior     |
| block_destructive... | true        | Never change                           |

PRs always require human approval. There is no auto-merge.

Step 3 -- Protect main branch
Require human reviewers on main/trunk in your git host.

Step 4 -- Graduation path: single-pass => maintenance => continuous

## HOW TO USE THIS SKILL

When activated in Claude Code or OpenClaw, read in this order:

1. CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md if present (base context)
2. CONFIG.yaml (runtime settings)
3. runtime/loop.md (execution model)
4. runtime/context-engineering.md (context budget rules)
5. runtime/status-management.md (restore checkpoint if resuming)
6. MEMORY.md (prior failure context)
7. agents/dispatcher.md (task decomposition model)
8. Begin the loop
