# TOOL ROUTER

## PURPOSE
Centralized control point for all tool usage. Every tool call passes through here.

---

## FLOW
```
Agent => Tool Request => Tool Router => Validate => Execute => Normalize Output => Return => Agent Validates
```

---

## RESPONSIBILITIES
1. **Validate inputs** -- reject malformed or dangerous requests before execution.
2. **Route** to the correct tool implementation.
3. **Normalize outputs** -- all results returned in standard format (see below).
4. **Enforce safety constraints** -- block destructive commands without approval.
5. **Log every call** -- write to `docs/generated/tool-logs/`.

---

## SAFETY RULES
- Block any destructive command (`write_file` on a non-draft path, `git_commit` without tests passing, server restarts in production) unless explicitly approved.
- Prevent infinite loops: if the same tool is called with the same input 3+ times in a row, halt and log.
- Enforce rate limits: no more than 10 tool calls per minute per agent.
- Never execute shell commands that were not pre-registered in `TOOL_REGISTRY.md`.

---

## STANDARD OUTPUT FORMAT

```json
{
  "status": "success | failure | blocked",
  "tool": "<tool name>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "outcome": "<one-line summary -- no raw data, no file contents>",
  "errors": "<error type and code -- not full stack trace or log lines>",
  "log_path": "docs/generated/tool-logs/<id>.json"
}
```

**Redaction rule**: before any tool result is written to a log or returned to an agent,
the router must strip or mask:
- Any value matching: `*key*`, `*token*`, `*password*`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`,
  `Bearer *`, `-----BEGIN *`, and strings > 64 chars that appear base64-encoded
- Full file contents (log the path, not the content)
- Raw HTTP response bodies (log status code and outcome only)

---

## PROTECTED PATHS (read-only to all agents)

The following files define how the harness operates. Agents may **read** them but must
**never write, overwrite, or delete** them. Only a human operator may change these files.

```
SKILL.md
CONFIG.yaml
agents/**
runtime/**
tools/**
references/harness-rules.md
```

Writes to any protected path must be **blocked** by the router and logged as a
`BLOCKED_WRITE` event. If an agent submits a write request to a protected path,
the dispatcher must be notified and the cycle must pause for human review.

The one writable reference file is `references/constraints.md` -- agents may **append**
Prevention Rules to it but may **never delete or overwrite** existing constraints.

---

## BLOCKED ACTIONS (require explicit human approval)
- Deleting files or directories
- Dropping databases or migrations
- Merging to main/trunk directly (PR required)
- Disabling security scans
- Modifying `CONFIG.yaml` runtime limits
